<p style="color:gold;"><b>Hi there!</b></p>
<br>For those of you who don't know me, I'm Max! I'm from Atlanta, GA, I'm blessed to have the loving support of my family - my two incredible parents and my three amazing sisters - and this is my first year at UGA. Without any previous experience in Miracle, I immediately sensed the commitment and love students on this campus have for the organization. So, I applied to be on a committee in order to get even more involved in Miracle. By some act of fate, I was selected for the Family Relations Committee, and I now have the privilege of caring for, hanging out with, and loving the family of Hudson Frame - the coolest, toughest, most energetic 3-year-old I know.</br>
<p>My oldest sister, Sammi, was born with spinal meningitis, which can cause severe birth defects if not caught early on. She spent the first two weeks of her life in intensive care, with my parents looking down on their newborn in a state of uncertainty. I can't even pretend I know how scarring an experience like that must have been for them, but I do know that other families - our Miracle families - go through similar experiences daily. Being able to support and love not only the kids but their families is why Miracle means so much to me.</p>
<p>UGA Miracle has been putting in the work For The Kids for over two decades now, raising over $5.7 million for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta! Just this past year, we raised $1,068,358.16, and if we can do it once there's no reason we can't do it again. Our 2,500+ members are completely devoted to loving, serving, and raising money all For The Kids.</p>
<p>If you feel so inclined, please donate to UGA Miracle using the link below. Any amount of money goes a long way! If monetary contributions aren't your thing, that's cool, too. Prayers and warm thoughts are just as welcomed.</p>
<br><b>With Love FTK,</b></br>
